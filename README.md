[Tiếng Việt](README.vi.md)

## Current State

This repository is in Harness v0.

There is no application implementation and no baked-in product specification
yet. The current work is the reusable project harness: the file structure,
agent operating model, feature intake process, story templates, and validation
expectations that help humans and agents turn a future user-provided spec into
implementation work.

## Product Sources

No product contract is currently defined.

When a user provides a project specification, add or reference it as the input
spec for the first buildout, then derive smaller living artifacts from it:

- `docs/product/`: current product contract files, created from the spec.
- `docs/stories/`: story packets and backlog created from selected work.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`: behavior-to-proof control panel.
- `docs/decisions/`: durable decisions and tradeoffs.

Do not keep a project-specific spec or product breakdown in this harness until
a real project supplies one.

## Harness Sources

- `AGENTS.md`: agent entrypoint and operating rules.
- `docs/HARNESS.md`: human-agent collaboration model.
- `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md`: tiny, normal, and high-risk work classification.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: generic architecture discovery and boundary rules.
- `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`: proposed harness improvements.
- `docs/templates/`: reusable spec-intake, story, decision, and validation
  templates.

## Working Rule

Implementation prompts do not go straight to code. They first pass through
feature intake, become story-sized work when needed, and then carry both
product validation and harness maintenance expectations.

## Install Harness Into A Project

### macOS, Linux, or Git Bash

From a target project directory, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonle0311/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --yes
```

Or install into a specific path:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonle0311/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --directory /path/to/project --yes
```

### Windows PowerShell

From a target project directory, run:

```powershell
& ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonle0311/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1?$(Get-Date -UFormat %s)"))) -Yes
```

Or install into a specific path:

```powershell
& ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonle0311/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1?$(Get-Date -UFormat %s)"))) -Directory "C:\path\to\project" -Yes
```

If the target already contains `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/`, the
installer warns and stops before writing files. Use an empty target directory,
or move those paths first. Use `--dry-run` to preview changes. The installer
itself and this repository's installer story are not copied into the target
project. On Windows PowerShell, use `-DryRun`, `-Force`, and `-Yes` instead of
the Bash-style `--dry-run`, `--force`, and `--yes` options.
